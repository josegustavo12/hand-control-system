Sure, here's the translation:

## Imports and Initializations

```python
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp
```

## Initializing the MediaPipe Holistic Module

```python
mp_holistic = mp.solutions.holistic
holistic = mp_holistic.Holistic(
    static_image_mode=False,         # For real-time videos
    model_complexity=1,              # Medium model complexity
    smooth_landmarks=True,           # Temporal smoothing of landmarks
    min_detection_confidence=0.5,    # Minimum confidence for initial detection
    min_tracking_confidence=0.5      # Minimum confidence for tracking
)
```
Values can be modified depending on the problem.

## Function "calculate_distance":

```python
def calculate_distance(point1, point2):
    return math.sqrt((point2.x - point1.x) ** 2 + (point2.y - point1.y) ** 2)
```
This function calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in 2D space.

## Function "normalized_to_pixel_coordinates":

This function facilitates the transition between normalized coordinates, ranging from 0 to 1 and used by MediaPipe Holistic to represent positions in the image, and pixel coordinates, which are used to draw landmarks on the image and perform distance calculations, as seen in the rest of the code.

```python
def normalized_to_pixel_coordinates(normalized_landmark, image_width, image_height):
    return int(normalized_landmark.x * image_width), int(normalized_landmark.y * image_height)
```
1. **Parameter Input:**
   - The function takes three parameters:
     - `normalized_landmark`: the normalized coordinates of the landmark (point) we want to convert.
     - `image_width`: the width of the image in pixels.
     - `image_height`: the height of the image in pixels.

2. **Calculating Pixel Coordinates:**
   - To convert normalized coordinates to pixels, we multiply the normalized coordinates by the corresponding dimensions of the image.
   - This is done by multiplying the normalized value of x by the image width and the normalized value of y by the image height.
   - This multiplication gives us the landmark coordinates in pixels in the image.

3. **Conversion to Integers:**
   - Since pixel coordinates can be floating-point numbers, we round these values to the nearest integer.
   - This is important because pixel coordinates must be integer numbers to be used correctly when drawing or performing other operations on the image.

4. **Output:**
   - The function returns the landmark coordinates converted to pixels in the image as an integer tuple, where the first element represents the x-coordinate and the second element represents the y-coordinate.

## Get monitor resolution and physical device size:

```python
monitors = get_monitors()
monitor = monitors[0]  
screen_width = monitor.width
screen_height = monitor.height
screen_width_mm = monitor.width_mm
screen_height_mm = monitor.height_mm
```
   - We use the `screeninfo` library to get the resolution and physical size of the monitor. This is used to calculate the pixels per centimeter ratio.

## Drawing Landmarks and Calculating Distance:

   - For each hand detected in the frame, we draw the landmarks using the `mp_drawing` module.
   - We calculate the distance between the thumb and index finger for each hand and display that distance on the screen using `cv2.putText`.
   - The distance is calculated in centimeters using the pixels per centimeter ratio obtained earlier.

This code is a functional implementation of real-time hand tracking with distance calculation between two fingers using MediaPipe Holistic. There is still an error in the distance calculation, but this calculation was made for demonstrative purposes only. At the end of the project, I will only use the calculation in pixels, as I will use this to control the computer's volume.
